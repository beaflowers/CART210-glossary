##Agency

Agency is "the capacity, condition, or state of acting or of exerting power". [^Merriam-Webster24agency] It is the sense that "I" am the one who is generating an action, and largely depends on the degree of discrepancy resulting from comparison between the predicted and actual sensory feedback.[^Atsushi+Yasuda05agency]
